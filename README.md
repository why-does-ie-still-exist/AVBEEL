# 𝔸𝔹𝕍𝔼𝔼𝕃

_A Very Bad Easily Extensible Language_

I was writing this based on my own ideas of making a langauge with RPN syntax and Loose Typing,
and then I realized I just wrote a forth interpreter in Java...

R.I.P. 𝔸𝔹𝕍𝔼𝔼𝕃 2019

I'll be using the [Tokenizer Code](AVBEEL/src/com/company/Tokenizer.java)
in a new language I'm making (𝔸𝔹𝕍𝔼𝔼𝕃 𝟚.𝟘 is in the works...)
